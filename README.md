# STATS-506-Final-Project

### Topic: 
#### Do people in the US from households with higher income consume more calories? 

### Introduction:
In daily life, diet energy intake has become a crucial factor when judging whether someone maintains a healthy lifestyle. Meanwhile, the amount of household income is one of the most important criteria of household economic status. It might be a pretty interesting topic to explore the relationship between income and diet energy intake. In this project, we are going to explore the correlation between income and energy intake using NHANE 2017-2018 diet data. Additionally, we will also take some other demographic variables like age, rurality, and gender into consideration.  By exploring the influence they play on our core relationship and the marginal effect might bring us some interesting findings.
